## Development Roadmap (Phased Approach)
2M transactions/day

#### Phase 1 (MVP - Core Lending Logic & Basic Integrations) 

1. Core Services (Go-kit):
2. User Auth Service (with basic KYC/registration).
3. Credit Decisioning Service (initial rule-based engine, placeholder for ML).
4. Transaction Service.
5. Installment Service (scheduling, tracking, basic late fees).
6. Payment Service (integration with one primary payment gateway, handling down payments).
7. Notification Service (basic SMS/email).
8. Consumer Facing: Basic web dashboard for payments/schedule.
9. Merchant Facing: Basic API for integration (no plugins yet).
10. Infrastructure: Cloud setup (basic Kubernetes cluster, managed databases, Kafka).

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement & Improvements

1. Credit Decisioning: Enhance with ML models (initial training data, feature engineering). Integrate with one credit bureau.
2. Payment Orchestration: Integrate with multiple payment gateways. Implement sophisticated retry logic for failed payments.
3. Installment Management: Full prepayment logic, detailed reporting.
4. Merchant Tools: Develop plugins for popular e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce). Merchant admin panel.
5. Fraud Detection: Implement advanced fraud detection techniques beyond basic rules.
6. Consumer App: Develop mobile apps (iOS/Android) with full dashboard features.
7. Compliance: Enhance audit logging, start planning for regulatory reporting.
8. Scalability Testing: Rigorous load testing to ensure 2M transactions/day can be handled.
9. Security: Aim for PCI DSS Level 3 or higher. Conduct first penetration test.

### Phase 3: New Features & Optimization

1. New Payment Plans: Introduce longer-term, interest-bearing plans (if business model allows and regulations permit).
2. Alternative Data: Explore using alternative data for credit scoring (with strict privacy and ethical considerations).
3. Advanced Analytics & Reporting: Comprehensive BI dashboards for internal teams and merchants.
